# Welcome to the Stratosphere Research Laboratory GitHub 👋

Our group conducts research at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity and helping others. We are part of the Artificial Intelligence Center, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## About

Stratosphere was founded in 2013 by Sebastian Garcia. Since then, our group has been home to dozen of researchers around the world commited to making the world a better place. 

## Our Datasets

One of our flagship contributions to the community is our cybersecurity datasets of malware network traffic. Here are some of our datasets that we love most:

- 🖥️ [CTU-13: a labeled dataset with botnet, normal and background traffic](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13)
- 📱 [Android Mischief Dataset: a dataset of network traffic from mobile phones infected with Android Remote Access Trojans](https://www.stratosphereips.org/android-mischief-dataset)
- 💡 [IoT-23: a labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23)

## Our Projects
