# Welcome to the Stratosphere Research Laboratory GitHub 👋

Our group conducts research at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity and helping others. We are part of the Artificial Intelligence Center, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## About

Stratosphere was founded in 2013 by Sebastian Garcia. Since then, our group has been home to dozens of researchers from around the world who are committed to making the world a better place. 

## Our Datasets

One of our flagship contributions to the community is our cybersecurity datasets of malware network traffic. Here are some of our datasets that we love most:

- 🖥️ [CTU-13: a labeled dataset with botnet, normal and background traffic](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13)
- 📱 [Android Mischief Dataset: a dataset of network traffic from mobile phones infected with Android Remote Access Trojans](https://www.stratosphereips.org/android-mischief-dataset)
- 💡 [IoT-23: a labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23)
- 🦠 [CTU-SME-11: a labeled dataset with real benign and malicious network traffic mimicking a SME enterprise environment](https://zenodo.org/records/7958259)
- 🍯 [CTU Hornet 65 Niner: A Network Dataset of Geographically Distributed Low-Interaction Honeypots](https://zenodo.org/records/13920267)

## Our Teaching

Since 2017, we have taught the _Introduction to Security_ class at the Czech Technical University in Prague. In 2024, this course was open to anyone in the world as a massive open online course (MOOC). Read more at our class website: https://cybersecurity.bsy.fel.cvut.cz
